## Configuration:
In AP `Stores -> Configuration -> Radosław Niestrój -> Payment Restriction Per Shipping`.

### General:
Enable module.

### Relations:
To add a new relationship, click the button `Add relation`, we get the option to choose the shipping method for which we choose the excluded payment methods. Only unselected methods will be available at checkout, if you leave the selection of payment methods blank, all of them will be available. When a given delivery method is not included in the table, it is not subject to filter (all payment methods are available for it). After each change, save with the `Save config` button.
